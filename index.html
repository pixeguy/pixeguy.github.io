                        <h3>Prehistory Times</h3>
                        <p>
                            All the way dating back to the prehistoric times, humans have already started the creation
                            of figurines. More specifically around 25-30,000 BC,
                            there were figurines made of stone, which were figures of women appearing pregnant, these
                            were known as the Venus figurines, presumably made to represent fertility.
                            Figurines slowly evolved over the years and materials got more advanced, such as pottery and
                            precious stones. No one knows the exact reason
                            for their creation or how they were used, but it is widely believed that they were used for
                            rituals and religious purposes.

                        <p>
                            Figurines at this time started to get more widely known. From Porcelain in 1500 BCE to
                            Ancient Greek Terracotta figurines in 30 BCE.
                            Figurines were made all around the world, using different materials and styles. The use of
                            them also started to change from mostly religious purposes and rituals,
                            to decorative purposes and a sign of wealth.

                            Nowadays, figurines are made out of an even wider variety of materials, mostly consisting of
                            plastic, and resin.
                            These were called figures and were mostly for entertainment and decorative or collecting
                            purposes. From many different regions came many different
                            types of figures, such as action figures, model figures, and even model kit figures.

                                Action figures, are most well known for their articulation and poseablity. Most commonly
                                made of out plastic, these figures are often based off fictional or
                                historical characters as toys. While they are often used as toys, recent times have seen
                                a
                                rise in popularity of the collection of these figures, this is due
                                to the increase in rarity of old figures and thus increase in value. Started in atleast

                                BCE, they used to be made of wood and clay. However, ever since the 1960s
                                when 'action figures' were first coined by Hasbro, they have been made mostly out of
                                plastic. The reason for coining the term 'action figure' was to market their new
                                new figure of a military themed character. It was aimed towards boys who refused to play
                                with 'dolls' which are normally a girl's toy.

                                older figures. Dating back to at least 200 BCE,
                                they were once made of wood and clay. Since the 1960s, they've been mostly plastic. The
