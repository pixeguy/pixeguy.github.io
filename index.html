                        <h3>Prehistory Times</h3>
                        <p>
                            All the way dating back to the prehistoric times, humans have already started the creation
                            of figurines. More specifically around 25-30,000 BC,
                            there were figurines made of stone, which were figures of women appearing pregnant, these
                            were known as the Venus figurines, presumably made to represent fertility.
                            Figurines slowly evolved over the years and materials got more advanced, such as pottery and
                            precious stones. No one knows the exact reason
                            for their creation or how they were used, but it is widely believed that they were used for
                            rituals and religious purposes.

                            Figurines at this time started to get more widely known. From Porcelain in 1500 BCE to

                            Nowadays, figurines are made out of an even wider variety of materials, mostly consisting of

                                Action figures, are most well known for their articulation and poseablity. Most commonly
                                made of out plastic, these figures are often based off fictional or
                                historical characters as toys. While they are often used as toys, recent times have seen
                                a
                                rise in popularity of the collection of these figures, this is due
                                to the increase in rarity of old figures and thus increase in value. Started in atleast

                                BCE, they used to be made of wood and clay. However, ever since the 1960s
                                when 'action figures' were first coined by Hasbro, they have been made mostly out of
                                plastic. The reason for coining the term 'action figure' was to market their new
                                new figure of a military themed character. It was aimed towards boys who refused to play
                                with 'dolls' which are normally a girl's toy.
